# Accommodation-Direct-Monitor
Studentbostäder.se is a Swedish website which is popularly used by new and existing students at Linköping University, Sweden, in which “Accommodation Direct” is a category of accommodation which is spontaneously uploaded on the concerned website and is rented on the “First Come First Serve” basis, which implies that the students have to actively monitor the website for the available offers continuously.

This project aims to automate the process of continuous monitoring of the offers in the concerned category to allow the students to manage their time efficiently. The skills used in the project include web scrapping using the Python package – Selenium which interacts with ChromeDriver to retrieve data from the website URL as seen in the browser, and integration of Telegram bots to generate notifications.
