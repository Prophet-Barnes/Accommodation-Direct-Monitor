# Accommodation-Direct-Monitor
Studentbostäder.se is a Swedish website which is popularly used by new and existing students at the Linköping University, Sweden in which “Accommodation Direct” is a category of accommodation which is spontaneously uploaded on the concerned website and is rented on the “First Come First Serve” basis, which implies that the students have to actively continuously monitor the website for the available offers.

This project aims at automating the process of continuous monitoring of the offers in the concerned category to provide the students with the ability of efficient time management. The skills used in the project include web scrapping using the Python package – Selenium which interacts with ChromeDriver to retrieve data from the website URL as seen in the browser, and integration of Telegram bots to generate notifications.
